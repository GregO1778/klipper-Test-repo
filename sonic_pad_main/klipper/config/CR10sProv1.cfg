# Klipper configuration to suit Creality CR-10 Smart
#
# In order to gain access to the USB port on the CR-10 Smart,
# you have to open up the printer and connect a Micro USB cable to the
# little breakout board which sits in between the mainboard and WiFi board"
# This file is setup for a direct drive setup (Bondtech LGXLite).
# Rotation distance for the extruder will need adjusting for a stndard extruder (included in this file).
#
# Please ensure you PID autotune your heaters rather than just using these PID values!
# You will also need to substitute your own serial address after sending ls /dev/serial/by-id/* via SSH
#
# This file contains pin mappings for the Creality CR-10 Smart
# with a Creality (Creality3D) CRC-2405V1.2 board (STM32F103RET6).
#
# To use this config, during "make menuconfig" select the STM32F103
# with a "28KiB bootloader" and serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9 via CH3400 to USB)
# communication. Enable PA0 GPIO pin on startup.
#
# Flash this firmware on the MCU by copying "out/klipper.bin" to an SD
# card and turning the printer on with the card inserted. The firmware
# filename must end in ".bin" and must not match the last filename
# that was flashed.
#
# The machine itself includes a small router that can run a Klipper
# frontend. You don't need to buy a single-board computer.
#
# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.
#
# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
#

#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
#samples_result: average
#   One can choose median or average between probes samples
#   The default is average.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if
#   sampling more than once.  Default is 2mm.
#bed_radius:
#   Defines the radius to probe for round beds.  Note that the radius
#   is relative to the nozzle's origin, if using a probe be sure to
#   account for its offset.  This parameter must be provided for round
#   beds and omitted for rectangular beds.

#min_point: 30,30
#   Defines the minimum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Note that this refers to the nozzle position, take care that
#   you do not define a point that will move the probe off of the bed.
#   This parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#mesh_max: 263, 300
mesh_max: 288, 288                      # this clears edges and clips with 300x300 bed & ReXT3D or factory part cooling duct
#max_point: 270,270
#   Defines the maximum x,y position to probe when for rectangular
#   beds. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point. Also note
#   that this does not necessarily define the last point probed, only
#   the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
probe_count: 5,5
#probe_count: 4,4
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each axis.
#   A single value is also valid, in which case that value will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this is integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
fade_start: 1
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled.  Default is 1.0.
fade_end: 10
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes.  When set
#   to a value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be
#   noted that fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a
#   print.  If a user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is
#   recommended. Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange"
#   or "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which
#   are forced to use lagrange sampling.  Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
